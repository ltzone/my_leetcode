## August 18th

### 435 Non Overlapping Intervals

> Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** 
  1. sort the intervals according to the begin time
  2. traverse the list and discard the intervals that has a later end


## August 19th

### 967 Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences

> Return all non-negative integers of length N such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is K.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** BFS/DFS, I use BFS

### 10 Regular Expression Matching

> Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Solution 1:** DFS/Recursion (20%time, 90%memory)
- **Improved Solution** Use DP to store intermediate result `match(s[i:],p[j:])`
- **Improved Solution** Use Bottom-Up DP to store intermediate result (45%time, 27%memory)

## August 20th

### 824 Goat Latin

- **Difficulty:** Easy
I don't wanna talk about it :)

### 1 Two Sum

> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Solution:** Since we only need to find one answer, I used hashmap

### 15 Three Sum

> Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. **The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.**

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** 
  - transform to two sum solution
  - Resolve Time Limit Exceed: first sort the nums, then use two pointers to find the `-nums[i]` target, remember to **skip duplicate entries** when looping.
  - Note when `nums = {}`, `i < nums.size()` won't work. 


## August 21st

### 143 Reorder List

> Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln, reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **My Solution:** Use a stack to store all the elements' pointers (Space Costly)
- **Solution:** Double Pointers
  - [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [1,2,3,6,5,4] -> [1,6,2,5,4,3]


### 41 First Missing Positive

> Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer. **Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.**

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Solution:** 
  - For `n` integers, the solution must be less or equal to `n+1`
  - For O(N) Space, we can use a bitmap (index as integer) to record whether an integer exists, then we can find the solution by checking the first non-existing integer
  - To integrate the O(n) bitmap into the original vector,
    - swap numbers
    - or use `+,-` as bool label and use absolute value to check the original number
  - 对于这种要求空间复杂度的，我们可以先考虑如果有一个等大的空间，我们可以怎么做。然后再考虑如果直接用原数组怎么做，主要是要保证数组的信息不要丢失。

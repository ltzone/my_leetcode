## August 18th

### 435 Non Overlapping Intervals

> Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** 
  1. sort the intervals according to the begin time
  2. traverse the list and discard the intervals that has a later end


## August 19th

### 967 Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences

> Return all non-negative integers of length N such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is K.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** BFS/DFS, I use BFS

### 10 Regular Expression Matching

> Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Solution 1:** DFS/Recursion (20%time, 90%memory)
- **Improved Solution** Use DP to store intermediate result `match(s[i:],p[j:])`
- **Improved Solution** Use Bottom-Up DP to store intermediate result (45%time, 27%memory)

## August 20th

### 824 Goat Latin

- **Difficulty:** Easy
I don't wanna talk about it :)

### 1 Two Sum

> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Solution:** Since we only need to find one answer, I used hashmap

### 15 Three Sum

> Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. **The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.**

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** 
  - transform to two sum solution
  - Resolve Time Limit Exceed: first sort the nums, then use two pointers to find the `-nums[i]` target, remember to **skip duplicate entries** when looping.
  - Note when `nums = {}`, `i < nums.size()` won't work.

## September 1st

### 55 Jump Game

> Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

> Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

> Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** Recursion -> DP -> Greedy
  - idea: `canJumpFrom(x)`

### 55 Merge Intervals

> Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

- **Difficulty:** Medium 
- **Solution:** sort then iterate


## September 2nd

### 949 Largest Time For Given Digits

> Given an array of 4 digits, return the largest 24 hour time that can be made.

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Solution:** Trivial

### 62 Unique Paths

> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

> How many possible unique paths are there?

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** Easy DP

### 64 Minimum Path Sum

> Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** Easy DP

### 70 Climb Stairs

> You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

> Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Solution:** Fibonacci, use dp


## Sepetember 3rd

### 220 Contains Duplicate III

> Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Solution:** **Use a BST(map) as a window**, where the original sorted results can be maintained. every time `i++`, only one element needs removing
- **Note:** Use `long` as the tree index to avoid overflow
